        talk_description: "Building software today is hard. In order to build complex software, you need to use different tools, api, frameworks and languages, which in the long run will lead to fragmentation, slowing you down.
The solution to this problem is to bring all the tools together into a unified interface.<br />
In this talk we will learn the benefit that a developer portal can bring into your organization, enhancing productivity and tackling problems such as Discoverability, System ownership, Fragmentation, Duplication, Context Switching. We will learn how you can easily build your own Developer Portal on top of Backstage, an Open Source framework for building Developer Portals adopted by companies like Spotify, Unity, Netflix, American Airlines, and Epic Games. <br />
 We will share the lessons learned and latest tips from the hundreds of Backstage adopters and thousands of contributors."

 My passion around developer experience including diversity, equal opportunities, mentoring and engagement is all a result of the way I learned and the people I met along the way.
<br />I believe that technology is for everyone and ultimately I hope to inspire people to follow their passion, share their experiences and open up their world to help drive and support others no matter what their background."

        talk_title: "The 'outer loop' is dead: How AI and cloud development will revolutionise developer experience"
        talk_description: "Git heavily influenced our developer tooling, and much of our developer tooling revolves around the 'post commit'.
        <br /> But, what if the commit was the last step, which came after our continuous integration? And, not before? We couldn’t do this before because we simply didn't have machines powerful enough to run our builds.
        <br />With cloud development environments, that's no longer the case. And with AI does this mean that we're on the cusp of a revolution of the pull request flow that has been so prevalent.
        <br />Is the combination of AI 'pair programming' and cloud based development the push that will take the industry away form the typical pull request UI and force us to completely re-think our developer experience? And what if our outer loop will be completely removed and consumed by workspaces in the cloud?'

In this speech Francesco summarises his experience of 25+ years in the IT industry, including the work as Product Manager for Backstage (Spotify) and now as part of the Docker's team. <br />

In particular, you are going to learn about the trajectory of the developer experience in the market and what you, as a developer, should be able to leverage and use very soon. For sure sooner than you expect.

        Or not? <br />

We are not cogs in a machine; companies are communities of people and do not thrive on efficiency alone. I will tell you about how the HR department at SparkFabrik has organized the recruitment, onboarding, and support processes, drawing from our experiences as developers. <br />

I'll show what we have done to streamline, optimize, and make our branch transparent. We will discuss the still-open challenges and some elephants in the room that, in my opinion, are increasingly ignored in discussions in this sector.
