        talk_title: "Optimizing Productivity: Embracing Developer Portals in Software Development"
        talk_description: "Building software today is hard. In order to build complex software, you need to use different tools, api, frameworks and languages, which in the long run will lead to fragmentation, slowing you down.
The solution to this problem is to bring all the tools together into a unified interface.<br />
In this talk we will learn the benefit that a developer portal can bring into your organization, enhancing productivity and tackling problems such as Discoverability, System ownership, Fragmentation, Duplication, Context Switching. We will learn how you can easily build your own Developer Portal on top of Backstage, an Open Source framework for building Developer Portals adopted by companies like Spotify, Unity, Netflix, American Airlines, and Epic Games. <br />
 We will share the lessons learned and latest tips from the hundreds of Backstage adopters and thousands of contributors.
